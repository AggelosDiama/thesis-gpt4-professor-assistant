# Thesis GPT4 professor assistant
This is the repository of my thesis about designing and creating a web app that will use the GPT-4 as part of a professor assistant in a coding laboratory.

The main idea is that the professor will upload their coding exercise with a set of grade criteria and the chatbot will produce a solution that the professor should either accept or correct it until it's acceptable for them. Then the as the student finish their code on their personal IDE they will upload their solution and immediately receive a thorough explanation on their possible mistakes as well as a grade. At the end, the model will produce a summary of all the solutions that will share with the professor with the goal to help them understand the level of understanding of the students on the respective exercise.
