### Thesis Diary - October

#### Week 1 - 16-22/10
- I prepared the github repository that I will use for my thesis as well as a github project connected with the repo. On the project table I added all the known tasks so far and even the "Thesis Defense" task to markdown the final week as a final milestone.
- I asked the CEID secretary office if I can write my thesis fully on English but turns out I can't. My professor said he will double check with CEID head professor.
- I created [a google doc]([url](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EYqgt1C1mx-dr7GbLZyau1PTke55NoP8JJA_I-yBLSg/edit?usp=sharing)) on my Thesis Google Drive folder where I gathered everything needed to know about how to use the GPT API key to share it with my professor to see how to proceed with the billing. It's still unknown if I have to belong to an organisation to fully use it. If it's needed, we have to check if we can create an account under University of Patras.
- I defined the basic technologies that I will need and will rpobably update them after the literature review.
- I started searching papers on ACM Digital Library with the keyword GPT and saved few on Zotero to go through them on Week 2.

#### Week 2 - 23-29/10
